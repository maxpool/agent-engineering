## Design System
- **Colors:** Dark gradient background 
- **Typography:** Apple system fonts, clear hierarchy with section headers
- **Layout:** Responsive cards, tables with hover states, insight callouts
- **Metrics:** Color-coded badges (green/orange/red for low/medium/high)

## Technical Implementation
- **Format:** Long webpage 
- **Navigation:** Section-based scrolling, no pagination
- **Interactivity:** Hover effects, export functionality, responsive tables
- **Performance:** Optimized for fast loading, mobile-friendly

## Content Philosophy
- **High Information Density:** Practical metrics, benchmarks, real-world trade-offs
- **Developer-Focused:** Implementation details, code examples, architecture patterns  
- **Evidence-Based:** Performance improvements with specific percentages and benchmarks
- **Production-Ready:** Emphasis on scalability, monitoring, cost optimization

## Community Links
- **Primary:** [join.maxpool.dev](https://join.maxpool.dev) - GenAI community join link
- **Integration:** Links in headers and footers across all pages
- **Purpose:** Community building around AI development resources

## Development Notes
- All content maintains scientific accuracy with cited performance improvements
- Responsive design tested for mobile/tablet/desktop viewing
- Cross-browser compatibility verified for modern browsers
