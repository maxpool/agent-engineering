  Writing Style:
  - Write as a technical expert explaining complex systems to other experienced engineers
  - Use long-form explanatory paragraphs that build concepts from first principles
  - Mix content types: prose, formulas, tables, algorithms, proofs, and architectural diagrams
  - Avoid bullet-point lists except for brief enumerations
  - No em-dashes or casual language
  - Generic and domain-agnostic (no specific use-case references unless essential)

  Technical Depth Requirements:
  1. Start with the Problem: Explain WHY this technology/architecture exists before explaining WHAT it is. What fundamental problem does it solve that existing
  solutions cannot?
  2. Mathematical Rigor:
    - Derive formulas from first principles, don't just state them
    - Explain each variable and its significance
    - Show how theoretical relationships translate to system behavior
    - Include complexity analysis (time/space) with explanations
  3. Trade-off Analysis:
    - Compare all major approaches/algorithms with quantitative metrics
    - Explain when each approach wins and why (no universal "best" solutions)
    - Include failure modes and limitations
    - Provide decision matrices based on system requirements
  4. From Theory to Practice:
    - Connect every formula to real-world implications
    - Show how theoretical limits manifest in production systems
    - Include capacity planning calculations with worked examples
    - Explain the gap between theoretical and practical performance
  5. Common Mistakes Section:
    - Include non-obvious pitfalls that experienced engineers encounter
    - Quantify the impact of each mistake
    - Explain why these mistakes are tempting
    - Provide detection and prevention strategies
  6. Scaling Evolution:
    - Show how architecture must evolve from prototype to production
    - Include concrete thresholds for architectural transitions
    - Provide formulas for capacity planning at each scale
    - Explain the trade-offs at each growth stage

  Content Structure Guidelines:
  - Begin with fundamental concepts before advanced topics
  - Build intuition through careful explanation before introducing formulas
  - Each section should flow naturally into the next
  - Include "why this matters" context for each technical concept
  - End with practical decision frameworks, not prescriptive recommendations

  Technical Coverage Checklist:
  - Problem definition and solution landscape
  - Theoretical foundations with proofs/derivations
  - All major algorithms/approaches with complexity analysis
  - Quantitative comparison matrices
  - Failure modes and edge cases
  - Performance characteristics under various workloads
  - Resource requirements and cost models
  - Testing strategies and benchmarking approaches
  - Migration paths and evolutionary architecture
  - Monitoring and operational considerations

  Quality Checks:
  - Does it explain WHY before HOW?
  - Are formulas derived, not just stated?
  - Does every theoretical concept connect to practical impact?
  - Are trade-offs presented neutrally with quantitative support?
  - Would an experienced engineer learn something new?
  - Is the content rigorous enough for system design interviews at top tech companies?
